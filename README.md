# Web-Design-Challenge
For this project, I created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations created in a weather analysis. 

The website contains 7 pages, including:

-The landing page contains:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page.
  
-Four visualization pages, each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
  
-A Comparisons" page that:
  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
  * Uses a bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
  
-A Data page that:
  * Displays a Bootstrap table containing the data used in the visualizations.
  * Python/Pandas was used to generate an HTML table from a pandas dataframe.

Navigation:
* Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
* Contains a dropdown on the right of the navbar named "Plots" which provides links to each individual visualization page.
